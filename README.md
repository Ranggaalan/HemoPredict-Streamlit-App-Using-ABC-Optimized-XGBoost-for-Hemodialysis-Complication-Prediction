# ü©∫ HemoPredict: Streamlit App Using ABC-Optimized XGBoost for Hemodialysis Complication Prediction

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19513b40-ab71-452a-9b67-c170039f289a)

**HemoPredict** is a powerful Streamlit-based machine learning web application developed to predict **hemodialysis complications**, such as **hypotension**, **hypertension**, and **intestinal disorders**. This system leverages the predictive power of **XGBoost** optimized by the **Artificial Bee Colony (ABC)** algorithm to improve accuracy and performance.

Designed with both functionality and usability in mind, the app integrates a real-time database, supports various input methods, and is deployed online for immediate access.

## üß™ Experiments and Evaluation

A total of **72 models** were evaluated using five different testing strategies with both **unbalanced** and **balanced datasets**:

- **Train-Test Splits**: 75:25 and 80:20
- **K-Fold Cross-Validation**: K = 3, 5, 7, 10
- Each scenario was repeated **5 times** to ensure robustness
